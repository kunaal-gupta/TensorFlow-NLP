Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub
This is a starter notebook for the guided project Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub
A complete version of this notebook is available in the course resources.

**Overview**
 * TensorFlow Hub is a repository of pre-trained TensorFlow models.
 * In this project, you will use pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub with tf.keras for text classification. Transfer learning makes it possible to save training resources and to achieve good model generalization even when training on a small dataset. In this project, we will demonstrate this by training with several different TF-Hub modules.

**Learning Objectives**
 By the time you complete this project, you will be able to:

 * Use various pre-trained NLP text embedding models from TensorFlow Hub
 * Perform transfer learning to fine-tune models on your own text data
 * Visualize model performance metrics with TensorBoard
 
**Prerequisites**
 In order to be successful with this project, it is assumed you are:

 * Competent in the Python programming language
 * Familiar with deep learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
 * Familiar with TensorFlow, and its Keras API
